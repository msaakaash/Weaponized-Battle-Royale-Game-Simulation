# Weaponized Battle Royale Simulation

## Overview
Weaponized Battle Royale Simulation is a Python-based battle royale simulation that utilizes **graph data structures** for player movement and **linked lists** for dynamic arsenal storage. The project is designed to optimize **gameplay mechanics** and **resource management** in large-scale simulations.

## Features
- **Graph-Based Player Movement:** Implemented using `NetworkX` to simulate a connected game map.
- **Dynamic Arsenal Storage:** Utilized linked lists for efficient weapon management.
- **Optimized Weapon Distribution:** Ensured fair and strategic distribution of weapons across the map.
- **Combat Resolution Algorithm:** Designed an efficient system for real-time decision-making.
- **Data Visualization:** Integrated `Matplotlib` for visual representation of player interactions and movements.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - Core programming language.
- **NetworkX** - Used for graph-based movement simulation.
- **Matplotlib** - For visualization of player interactions.
- **Linked Lists** - Implemented for dynamic arsenal storage.
